# Governance Model

OpenDemocracy AI is community-governed. No single entity, company, or individual controls the project's direction. This document defines how decisions are made, who makes them, and how governance itself can evolve.

## Principles

1. **Transparency**: All decisions are made in public, with documented rationale.
2. **Participation**: Anyone can propose changes to code, governance, or direction.
3. **Consent over consensus**: Proposals move forward unless there are reasoned objections — not because everyone enthusiastically agrees.
4. **Meritocracy of ideas**: Arguments are evaluated on their merits, not on who makes them.
5. **Forkability**: The project is Apache 2.0 licensed. Disagreement always has an exit — anyone can fork.

## Roles

### Contributors
Anyone who submits a merged pull request, files a useful issue, improves documentation, helps with community organizing, or contributes in any meaningful way.

### Maintainers
Contributors who have demonstrated sustained, high-quality involvement. Maintainers can:
- Merge pull requests
- Triage issues
- Participate in governance votes

New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and approved by a simple majority vote.

### Steering Committee
A small group (3-7 people) responsible for:
- Resolving disputes that maintainers cannot settle
- Making time-sensitive decisions when full community process is too slow
- Ensuring the project adheres to its core principles
- Managing project infrastructure and accounts

Steering committee members are elected annually by maintainers. Any maintainer can stand for election.

## Decision-Making Process

### Day-to-Day Decisions
- Maintainers make routine decisions (merging PRs, triaging issues) independently.
- When in doubt, seek a second opinion from another maintainer.

### Significant Decisions
For changes that affect architecture, governance, core principles, or project direction:

1. **Proposal**: Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue with the `governance` label.
2. **Discussion period**: Minimum 7 days for community input.
3. **Revision**: Author revises the proposal based on feedback.
4. **Vote**: Maintainers vote. Decisions require a simple majority with a minimum quorum of 50% of active maintainers.
5. **Record**: The decision and rationale are recorded in the project's decision log.

### Governance Changes
Changes to this governance document require:
- A 14-day discussion period
- A two-thirds supermajority of active maintainers
- Steering committee approval

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion**: Parties attempt to resolve the disagreement through open dialogue.
2. **Mediation**: If unresolved, a neutral maintainer mediates.
3. **Steering Committee**: If still unresolved, the steering committee makes a binding decision.
4. **Fork**: As a last resort, the open-source license guarantees the right to fork.

## Current Steering Committee

*To be established as the community grows. Initial project founders serve as interim stewards.*

## Amendments

This governance model is a living document. It will evolve as the community grows and learns. Propose changes by opening a PR against this file.
