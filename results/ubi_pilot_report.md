> "I'm in favor of UBI. It would help caregivers, artists, volunteers — people who do essential work that the market doesn't compensate. I've changed my mind on this over time."

> "As a small business owner, I think UBI would be great for entrepreneurship. People could take risks knowing they won't starve if they fail. My experience confirms this view."

## Projected Scenarios

### Scenario: Optimistic

UBI implemented with complementary reforms (education investment, job retraining). Inflation managed through monetary policy. Strong poverty reduction with moderate fiscal cost.

**Assumptions:**
- Complementary education and retraining investment
- Active monetary policy management
- Gradual phase-in over 2 years
- UBI set at poverty-line level

| Dimension | Short-term | Medium-term | Long-term | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| poverty_rate | -6.31% | -11.48% | -15.57% | 65% |
| labor_force_participation | -0.47% | -0.14% | -0.02% | 50% |
| inflation | +0.70% | +0.12% | +0.01% | 45% |
| entrepreneurship_rate | +2.57% | +4.90% | +6.82% | 50% |
| fiscal_cost_gdp_share | +0.90% | +2.40% | +4.50% | 55% |
| mental_health_improvement | +4.31% | +8.01% | +11.00% | 55% |

**Key tradeoffs:**
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while mental_health_improvement improves (+11.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.27)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while entrepreneurship_rate improves (+6.82%) over the long term. (severity: 0.22)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while fiscal_cost_gdp_share improves (+4.50%) over the long term. (severity: 0.20)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while inflation improves (+0.01%) over the long term. (severity: 0.16)
- labor_force_participation worsens (-0.02%) while mental_health_improvement improves (+11.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.11)


### Scenario: Moderate (base case)

UBI at a modest level with partial reform. Mixed effects: clear poverty reduction, small labor market shifts, manageable inflation.

**Assumptions:**
- Partial complementary reforms
- Standard monetary policy
- Phase-in over 3 years
- UBI set at 75% of poverty-line level

| Dimension | Short-term | Medium-term | Long-term | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| poverty_rate | -6.31% | -11.48% | -15.57% | 65% |
| labor_force_participation | -1.28% | -0.60% | -0.21% | 45% |
| inflation | +1.42% | +0.41% | +0.07% | 40% |
| entrepreneurship_rate | +2.57% | +4.90% | +6.82% | 50% |
| fiscal_cost_gdp_share | +1.50% | +4.00% | +7.50% | 60% |
| mental_health_improvement | +4.31% | +8.01% | +11.00% | 55% |

**Key tradeoffs:**
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while mental_health_improvement improves (+11.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.27)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while fiscal_cost_gdp_share improves (+7.50%) over the long term. (severity: 0.23)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while entrepreneurship_rate improves (+6.82%) over the long term. (severity: 0.22)
- poverty_rate worsens (-15.57%) while inflation improves (+0.07%) over the long term. (severity: 0.16)
- labor_force_participation worsens (-0.21%) while mental_health_improvement improves (+11.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.11)


### Scenario: Pessimistic

UBI implemented without complementary reforms. Inflation erodes purchasing power. Labor participation drops significantly. Fiscal cost grows unsustainably.

**Assumptions:**
- No complementary policy reforms
- Loose monetary policy
- Immediate full implementation
- UBI set above poverty-line level

| Dimension | Short-term | Medium-term | Long-term | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| poverty_rate | -2.24% | -4.39% | -6.23% | 50% |
| labor_force_participation | -2.35% | -4.78% | -6.93% | 40% |
| inflation | +4.73% | +8.61% | +11.68% | 35% |
| entrepreneurship_rate | +1.28% | +0.60% | +0.21% | 35% |
| fiscal_cost_gdp_share | +3.60% | +9.60% | +18.00% | 50% |
| mental_health_improvement | +1.65% | +0.61% | +0.15% | 40% |

**Key tradeoffs:**
- labor_force_participation worsens (-6.93%) while fiscal_cost_gdp_share improves (+18.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.25)
- poverty_rate worsens (-6.23%) while fiscal_cost_gdp_share improves (+18.00%) over the long term. (severity: 0.24)
- labor_force_participation worsens (-6.93%) while inflation improves (+11.68%) over the long term. (severity: 0.19)
- poverty_rate worsens (-6.23%) while inflation improves (+11.68%) over the long term. (severity: 0.18)
