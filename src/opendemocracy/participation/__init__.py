"""Participation layer: verified submission of opinions, ideas, and votes.

Every submission requires a valid biometric verification.  The system
enforces **one submission per person per topic** — once you've submitted
your opinion, idea, or vote on a topic, that's your one entry.  This is
enforced by the anonymous voter ID from the identity layer.
